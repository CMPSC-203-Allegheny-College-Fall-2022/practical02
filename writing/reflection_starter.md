# Reflection on Writing Maintainable Tests

## Describe the code that someone would write to import the `PermitManager` class. Then, describe the code someone would write to use the `PermitManager` class to issue a permit, revoke a permit, and check whether an owner can park based on their license plate number

TODO

## Explain what the `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` decorator does and how the `setup` function improves the clarity of all other tests, mentioning the global-level `PermitManager` object

TODO

## Identify two reasons why the `test_permit_manager` test is unclear

TODO

## Propose at least one way to improve the maintainability of the `test_permit_manager` test

TODO

## Explain why the `test_next_sticker_increments_next_sticker_number` test is brittle

TODO

## Considering the existence of the `test_issue_assigns_unique_sticker_numbers` test, determine whether the `test_next_sticker_increments_next_sticker_number` test should be removed and explain how you made this determination

TODO
